libthreadpass
-------------

This is a simple library that pretty much is complete.

All it does is provide a simple way to send data between threads where one thread waits for the other to receive the data. There can be many senders, but only one receiver at a time so it has a server client like model which is easy to work with. If you want to see how to use it look at test.c in this directory and the man page (libthreadpass.3).
